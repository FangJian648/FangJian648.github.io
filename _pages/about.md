Hi there! I am currently a master's student at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), advised by [Prof. Shaohui Liu](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/liushaohui). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology. My research interests include multimodal large language models and adversarial attacks. 

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me!
