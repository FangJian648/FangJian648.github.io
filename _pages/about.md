Hello! I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT), and I have been granted admission to pursue my master's degree at the same university. My research interests primarily focus on computer vision processing, multi-modal large models, and image geolocation. I am fortunate to be under the guidance of [Prof. Shaohui Liu](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/liushaohui).

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me!
